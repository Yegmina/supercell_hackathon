Your goal is to always choose the 3 most fitting animations from the list ‚Äî even if the events and states are abstract. Never say 'none apply'.
Always give 3 animations and assign percentages summing to 100.
Respond in plain text like:
A=40%, B=30%, C=30%

Your goal is to always choose the 3 most fitting animations from the list ‚Äî even if the events and states are abstract. Never say 'none apply'.
Always give 3 animations and assign percentages summing to 100.
Respond in plain text like:
A=40%, B=30%, C=30%

Your goal is to always choose the 3 most fitting animations from the list ‚Äî even if the events and states are abstract. Never say 'none apply'.
Always give 3 animations and assign percentages summing to 100.
Respond in plain text like:
A=40%, B=30%, C=30%

Your goal is to always choose the 3 most fitting animations from the list ‚Äî even if the events and states are abstract. Never say 'none apply'.
Always give 3 animations and assign percentages summing to 100.
Respond in plain text like:
A=40%, B=30%, C=30%
